# Overview

This is a multiple choice adventure comedy game developed using Ren'Py. The game's main controls are simple. Click to advance the text, select whichever option you want when a choice appears, and use the bar at the bottom to save and load the game.

I wrote this software in order to enhance my game development skillset and create an entertaining story-driven experience.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the Ren'Py game development program.

The language used is a custom Ren'Py language, though it is loosely based around Python.

# Future Work

* In the future, I will likely take time to alter the game's subject matter to be more palatable, as the gimmick within this demo aged poorly and may be seen as disturing to some players.

* After changing the game's themes to be more appropriate, I may possibly continue development if I see enough potential.
